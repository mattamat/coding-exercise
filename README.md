# Coding Exercise

## Assumptions

- There same two teams will never play two matches at the same time. Brazil vs Japan can only be once in the scoreboard.
  - Would implement logic at a later stage if this might be a problem. Match id or something.
- In a more detailed solution I would have created my own exceptions to make it more clear what is failing. 
- Assuming a team cannot play against itself (No two teams with the same name)
